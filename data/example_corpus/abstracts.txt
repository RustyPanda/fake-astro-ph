Many analyses of astronomical data sets, ranging from morphological classification of galaxies to identification of supernova candidates, have relied on humans to classify data into distinct categories. Crowdsourced galaxy classifications via the Galaxy Zoo project provided a solution that scaled visual classification for extant surveys by harnessing the combined power of thousands of volunteers. However, the much larger data sets anticipated from upcoming surveys will require a different approach. Automated classifiers using supervised machine learning have improved considerably over the past decade but their increasing sophistication comes at the expense of needing ever more training data. Crowdsourced classification by human volunteers is a critical technique for obtaining these training data. But several improvements can be made on this zeroth order solution. Efficiency gains can be achieved by implementing a “cascade filtering” approach whereby the task structure is reduced to a set of binary questions that are more suited to simpler machines while demanding lower cognitive loads for humans.Intelligent subject retirement based on quantitative metrics of volunteer skill and subject label reliability also leads to dramatic improvements in efficiency. We note that human and machine classifiers may retire subjects differently leading to trade-offs in performance space. Drawing on work with several Zooniverse projects including Galaxy Zoo and Supernova Hunter, we will present recent findings from experiments that combine cohorts of human and machine classifiers. We show that the most efficient system results when appropriate subsets of the data are intelligently assigned to each group according to their particular capabilities.With sufficient online training, simple machines can quickly classify “easy” subjects, leaving more difficult (and discovery-oriented) tasks for volunteers. We also find humans achieve higher classification purity while samples produced by machines are typically more complete. These findings set the stage for further investigations, with the ultimate goal of efficiently and accurately labeling the wide range of data classes that will arise from the planned large astronomical surveys. We recently found an ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) with a half-light radius of R e = 2.2 kpc and little or no dark matter. The total mass of NGC1052─DF2 was measured from the radial velocities of bright compact objects that are associated with the galaxy. Here, we analyze these objects using a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and Keck spectroscopy. Their average size is < {r}h> =6.2+/- 0.5 pc and their average ellipticity is < ε > =0.18+/- 0.02. From a stacked Keck spectrum we derive an age of ≳9 Gyr and a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −1.35 + 0.12. Their properties are similar to ω Centauri, the brightest and largest globular cluster in the Milky Way, and our results demonstrate that the luminosity function of metal-poor globular clusters is not universal. The fraction of the total stellar mass that is in the globular cluster system is similar to that in other UDGs, and consistent with “failed galaxy” scenarios, where star formation terminated shortly after the clusters were formed. However, the galaxy is a factor of ∼1000 removed from the relation between globular cluster mass and total galaxy mass that has been found for other galaxies, including other UDGs. We infer that a dark matter halo is not a prerequisite for the formation of metal-poor globular cluster-like objects in high-redshift galaxies. We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of two ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with measured stellar velocity dispersions in the Coma cluster. The galaxies, Dragonfly 44 and DFX1, have effective radii of 4.7 kpc and 3.5 kpc and velocity dispersions of {47}-6+8 km s-1 and {30}-7+7 km s-1, respectively. Both galaxies are associated with a striking number of compact objects, tentatively identified as globular clusters: {N}{gc}=74+/- 18 for Dragonfly 44 and {N}{gc}=62+/- 17 for DFX1. The number of globular clusters is much higher than expected from the luminosities of the galaxies but is consistent with expectations from the empirical relation between dynamical mass and globular cluster count defined by other galaxies. Combining our data with previous HST observations of Coma UDGs we find that UDGs have a factor of {6.9}-2.4+1.0 more globular clusters than other galaxies of the same luminosity, in contrast to a recent study of a similar sample by Amorisco et al., but consistent with earlier results for individual galaxies. The Harris et al. relation between globular cluster count and dark matter halo mass implies a median halo mass of {M}{halo}̃ 1.5× {10}11 {M}☉ for the sixteen Coma UDGs that have been observed with HST so far, with the largest and brightest having {M}{halo}̃ 5× {10}11 {M}.
 Rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles are obtained for 11 faint elliptical galaxies, together with central velocity dispersions for an additional six faint ellipticals. It is noted that faint ellipticals rotate more rapidly than bright ellipticals, and almost as rapidly as predicted by models with oblate figures and isotropic distributions of residual velocities. No significant difference is found between disk galaxy bulge rotational properties and ellipticals with similar absolute magnitudes, when ellipticity differences are taken into account. Attention is given to the relation between central velocity dispersion and luminosity, and indication is found that it may be steeper at low luminosities. It may be possible to satisfy the empirical correlation between rotation and luminosity, if the ellipticals formed in a clustering hierarchy, although the slow rotation of bright ellipticals is difficult to reconcile with their high densities.
Long exposures of the complexes of ionized hydrogen in both the LMC and SMC have been taken with the 48-in. SRC Schmidt camera through a H-alpha + forbidden NII interference filter of 100-A bandwidth. These plates and identifying charts are presented in a form in which little information is lost. A catalog of many individual emission regions in both these galaxies is also compiled. The relationships between the nebulosities and OB associations as well as between 21-cm neutral hydrogen emission and continuum radio emission are discussed, and a number of supernova-remnant candidates are listed for further study. We investigate the accuracy of the parametric recovery of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) of the stars in a galaxy while working in pixel space. Problems appear when the data have a low signal-to-noise ratio or the observed LOSVD is not well sampled by the data. We propose a simple solution based on maximum penalized likelihood, and we apply it to the common situation in which the LOSVD is described by a Gauss-Hermite series. We compare different techniques by extracting the stellar kinematics from observations of the barred lenticular galaxy NGC 3384 obtained with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph.  We investigate the well-known correlations between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and other global observables of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics to about one effective (half-light) radius Re. They have well-calibrated I-band Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 and large-field ground-based photometry, accurate surface brightness fluctuation distances, and their observed kinematics is consistent with an axisymmetric intrinsic shape. All these factors result in an unprecedented accuracy in the M/L measurements. We find a tight correlation of the form (M/L) = (3.80 +/- 0.14) × (σe/200kms-1)0.84+/-0.07 between the M/L (in the I band) measured from the dynamical models and the luminosity-weighted second moment σe of the LOSVD within Re. The observed rms scatter in M/L for our sample is 18 per cent, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is ~13 per cent. The (M/L)-σe relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight correlations between σe and other galaxy global observables. The comparison of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the `tilt' of the FP of early-type galaxies, describing the deviation of the FP from the virial relation, is almost exclusively due to a real M/L variation, while structural and orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. When the photometric parameters are determined in the `classic' way, using growth curves, and the σe is measured in a large aperture, the virial mass appears to be a reliable estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies, and can be safely used where more `expensive' models are not feasible (e.g. in high-redshift studies). In this case the best-fitting virial relation has the form (M/L)vir= (5.0 +/- 0.1) ×Reσ2e/(LG), in reasonable agreement with simple theoretical predictions. We find no difference between the M/L of the galaxies in clusters and in the field. The comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)pop inferred from the analysis of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in early-type galaxies of ~30 per cent of the total mass inside one Re, in broad agreement with previous studies, and it also shows that the stellar initial mass function varies little among different galaxies. Our results suggest a variation in M/L at constant (M/L)pop, which seems to be linked to the galaxy dynamics. We speculate that fast-rotating galaxies have lower dark matter fractions than the slow-rotating and generally more-massive ones. If correct, this would suggest a connection between the galaxy assembly history and the dark matter halo structure. The tightness of our correlation provides some evidence against cuspy nuclear dark matter profiles in galaxies. his paper focuses on cosmological constraints derived from analysis of WMAP data alone. A simple ΛCDM cosmological model fits the five-year WMAP temperature and polarization data. The basic parameters of the model are consistent with the three-year data and now better constrained: Ω b h 2 = 0.02273 + 0.00062, Ω c h 2 = 0.1099 + 0.0062, ΩΛ = 0.742 + 0.030, ns = 0.963+0.014 -0.015, τ = 0.087 + 0.017, and σ8 = 0.796 + 0.036, with h = 0.719+0.026 -0.027. With five years of polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization, τ>0, at 5σ significance. The redshift of an instantaneous reionization is constrained to be z reion = 11.0 + 1.4 with 68% confidence. The 2σ lower limit is z reion > 8.2, and the 3σ limit is z reion > 6.7. This excludes a sudden reionization of the universe at z = 6 at more than 3.5σ significance, suggesting that reionization was an extended process. Using two methods for polarized foreground cleaning we get consistent estimates for the optical depth, indicating an error due to the foreground treatment of τ ~ 0.01. This cosmological model also fits small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, and a range of astronomical data measuring the expansion rate and clustering of matter in the universe. We find evidence for the first time in the CMB power spectrum for a nonzero cosmic neutrino background, or a background of relativistic species, with the standard three light neutrino species preferred over the best-fit ΛCDM model with N eff = 0 at >99.5% confidence, and N eff > 2.3(95%confidence limit (CL)) when varied. The five-year WMAP data improve the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r < 0.43(95%CL), for power-law models, and halve the limit on r for models with a running index, r < 0.58(95%CL). With longer integration we find no evidence for a running spectral index, with dns /dln k = -0.037 + 0.028, and find improved limits on isocurvature fluctuations. The current WMAP-only limit on the sum of the neutrino masses is ∑m ν < 1.3 eV(95%CL), which is robust, to within 10%, to a varying tensor amplitude, running spectral index, or dark energy equation of state. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team. We present cosmological parameters derived from the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation observed at 148 GHz and 218 GHz over 296 deg2 with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) during its 2008 season. ACT measures fluctuations at scales 500 < l < 10, 000. We fit a model for the lensed CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and foreground contribution to the 148 GHz and 218 GHz power spectra, including thermal and kinetic SZ, Poisson power from radio and infrared point sources, and clustered power from infrared point sources. At l = 3000, about half the power at 148 GHz comes from primary CMB after masking bright radio sources. The power from thermal and kinetic SZ is estimated to be B_{3000}=6.8 \,+/-\, 2.9 \,\mu K^2, where B_\ell \equiv \ell (\ell \,+\,1){C}_\ell /2\pi. The IR Poisson power at 148 GHz is B_{3000} = 7.8+/- 0.7 \,\mu K^2 (C l = 5.5 + 0.5 nK2), and a clustered IR component is required with B_{3000} = 4.6+/- 0.9 \,\mu K^2, assuming an analytic model for its power spectrum shape. At 218 GHz only about 15% of the power, approximately 27 μK2, is CMB anisotropy at l = 3000. The remaining 85% is attributed to IR sources (approximately 50% Poisson and 35% clustered), with spectral index α = 3.69 + 0.14 for flux scaling as S(ν)vpropνα. We estimate primary cosmological parameters from the less contaminated 148 GHz spectrum, marginalizing over SZ and source power. The ΛCDM cosmological model is a good fit to the data (χ2/dof = 29/46), and ΛCDM parameters estimated from ACT+Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) are consistent with the seven-year WMAP limits, with scale invariant ns = 1 excluded at 99.7% confidence level (CL) (3σ). A model with no CMB lensing is disfavored at 2.8σ. By measuring the third to seventh acoustic peaks, and probing the Silk damping regime, the ACT data improve limits on cosmological parameters that affect the small-scale CMB power. The ACT data combined with WMAP give a 6σ detection of primordial helium, with YP = 0.313 + 0.044, and a 4σ detection of relativistic species, assumed to be neutrinos, with N eff = 5.3 + 1.3 (4.6 + 0.8 with BAO+H 0 data). From the CMB alone the running of the spectral index is constrained to be dns /dln k = -0.034 + 0.018, the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r < 0.25 (95% CL), and the possible contribution of Nambu cosmic strings to the power spectrum is constrained to string tension Gμ < 1.6 × 10-7 (95% CL).  Classical novae were revealed as a surprise source of γ-rays in Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations. During the first 8 yr since the LAT was launched, 6 novae in total have been detected to >5σ in γ-rays, in contrast to the 69 discovered optically in the same period. We attempt to resolve this discrepancy by assuming all novae are γ-ray emitters, and assigning peak 1 d fluxes based on a flat distribution of the known emitters to a simulated population. To determine optical parameters, the spatial distribution and magnitudes of bulge and disc novae in M31 are scaled to the Milky Way, which we approximate as a disc with a 20 kpc radius and elliptical bulge with semimajor axis 3 kpc and axis ratios 2:1 in the xy plane. We approximate Galactic reddening using a double exponential disc with vertical and radial scaleheights of rd = 5 kpc and zd = 0.2 kpc, and demonstrate that even such a rudimentary model can easily reproduce the observed fraction of γ-ray novae, implying that these apparently rare sources are in fact nearby and not intrinsically rare. We conclude that classical novae with mR ≤ 12 and within ≈ 8 kpc are likely to be discovered in γ-rays using the Fermi LAT. We make radial measurements of stellar initial mass function (IMF) sensitive absorption features in the two massive early-type galaxies NGC 1277 and IC 843. Using the Oxford Short Wavelength Integral Field specTrogaph (SWIFT), we obtain resolved measurements of the Na I 0.82 and FeH 0.99 indices, amongst others, finding both galaxies show strong gradients in Na I absorption combined with flat FeH profiles at ̃0.4 A. We find these measurements may be explained by radial gradients in the IMF, appropriate abundance gradients in [Na/Fe] and [Fe/H], or a combination of the two, and our data are unable to break this degeneracy. We also use full spectral fitting to infer global properties from an integrated spectrum of each object, deriving a unimodal IMF slope consistent with Salpeter in IC 843 (x = 2.27 + 0.17) but steeper than Salpeter in NGC 1277 (x = 2.69 + 0.11), despite their similar FeH equivalent widths. Independently, we fit the strength of the FeH feature and compare to the E-MILES and CvD12 stellar population libraries, finding agreement between the models. The IMF values derived in this way are in close agreement with those from spectral fitting in NGC 1277 (x_{CvD}=2.59^{+0.25}_{-0.48}, x_{E-MILES}=2.7 + 0.31), but are less consistent in IC 843, with the IMF derived from FeH alone leading to steeper slopes than when fitting the full spectrum (x_{CvD}=2.57^{+0.30}_{-0.41}, x_{E-MILES}=2.7 + 0.25). This work highlights the importance of a large wavelength coverage for breaking the degeneracy between abundance and IMF variations, and may bring into doubt the use of the Wing-Ford band as an IMF index if used without other spectral information. We present the results of a large library of cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law initial spectra. The non-linear evolution of the matter power spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that highly non-linear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free spectra define a non-linear locus that is clearly shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale non-linear power increases as both the power spectrum index n and the density parameter Ω decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can be understood as resulting from the modification of dark matter haloes by continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo model' for non-linear structure; we use this approach to fit both our scale-free results and also our previous cold dark matter data. This method is more accurate than the commonly used Peacock-Dodds formula and should be applicable to more general power spectra.
